Part 1: WeatherPy
Welcome to WeatherPy! This project involves visualizing the weather of 500+ cities at different distances from the equator.

Requirement 1: Create Plots
Use the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data for cities generated in the starter code. Create scatter plots for the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature
Latitude vs. Humidity
Latitude vs. Cloudiness
Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Requirement 2: Linear Regression
Compute linear regression for each relationship. Split the plots into Northern Hemisphere (>= 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (< 0 degrees latitude). Create scatter plots with the linear regression line, formula, and r values.

Part 2: VacationPy
Welcome to VacationPy! This part involves using your weather data skills to plan future vacations.

Main Tasks:
Your main tasks are to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library, applying your Python skills to create map visualizations. Here's a quick overview:

Create Map Visualizations:
Use the geoViews Python library to make map visualizations.
Explore the relationships between weather variables and location on the map.

# Conclusions
WeatherPy provides insights into weather variables and latitude relationships.
VacationPy empowers you to blend weather data with geography for effective vacation planning. Leverage maps and Python to make informed decisions.
